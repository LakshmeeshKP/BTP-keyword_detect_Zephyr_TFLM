Note:

The project is not fully completed. It has some CMSIS-DSP library issues, due to which the spectrogram generation section of the code halts the program.

Just adding or removing printk statements (used for debugging) in a very specific manner inside the spectrogram function, caused the program to work / not work. Most of the times it didn't work.
