Note:

The project is not fully completed. It has some CMSIS-DSP library issues, due to which the spectrogram generation section of the code halts the program.

Just adding or removing printk statements (used for debugging) inside the spectrogram function, caused the program to work / not work. Mostly it didn't work.
